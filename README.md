# Hello, Azure!
# Abstract
In this hands-on workshop we’ll get up and running in the Azure cloud with a focus on web applications, APIs, and other tools.

New to Azure? No Problem! Learn how to build and deploy your applications from scratch, exploring the cloud deployment options from Serverless to Containers, and languages from Python to Go. We’ll dive into tools like Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and CI/CD to enable fast-paced collaboration with team members. 

Expect plenty of tools, tips, tricks, and sample code that will enable you to get up and running quickly no matter what you are hacking on. Bring your laptop. GitHub account recommended. Azure Accounts (and credit) will be provided.
